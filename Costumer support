Hai. I'm really glad you opened it ^^ 
As said before
I noticed the customer support is pretty
overflowed, so I decided to ask if I may
help and join the team. Since my friend
was waiting for supports response quite
really long time. Even on online chat
support he was waiting for over 30mins
(1st in queue)

Something about me:
I'm 23 (soon 24) years old boy
From Czech republic
My english is pretty good I believe

Oh yes, since I'm from Czechia I could
do only online stuff obviously
Tho I have a job so couldn't work full
time for the game

Hopefully I wrote enough and not too much ðŸ˜…
I will answer any question if needed.
Thank you for reading and bye bye ðŸ˜Š
